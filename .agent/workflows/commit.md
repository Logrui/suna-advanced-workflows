Run git add . and git commit with a custom commit message for the most recent tasks completed in recent context

Then ask the user for permission to push the commit to remote repository summarizing the following:
-Current branch we are on
-Commit message of your recent push
-Commit number of most recent commits

Ensure we are not in a detached head state - if so notify the user IMMEDIATELY and provide some options for remediation
